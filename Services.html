                     <p>What makes us unique in the development world is that we don't use WordPress, frameworks, or page builders. We meticulously write the code line by line. This gives us much more control over the design, and the website performs lightning fast because there's no bloated or messy code that slows it down.</p>
                     <p>
                        Websites built by hand will out-perform most WordPress sites and drag and drop page builders which could cost thousands of dollars. When it comes to the web, the faster and more organized websites win.
